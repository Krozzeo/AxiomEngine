# Script lifecycle

Axiom.Gameplay API reference. Unity naming baseline: Unity 6.3 LTS.

Override public callbacks; Unity-style private message methods are not reflected. Existing OnStart/OnUpdate/OnStop overrides remain supported and take precedence if they do not call base. FixedUpdate uses a local 0.02-second accumulator and is not yet a solver-owned callback. LateUpdate follows Update for each behaviour, not a separate global phase. Time uses doubles. Coroutines, Invoke, timeScale and scene loading remain pending.
